{"name":"bling.vim","tagline":"(Y)et (A)nother (V)im (D)istribution","body":"## introduction\r\n\r\nthis is my personal vim distribution that i have tweaked over time and evolved from a simple vanilla vimrc configuration to a full-blown distribution that it is today.\r\n\r\nwhile it is quite easy to install this distribution (i designed it that way for me to easily switch between computers), i actually recommend that you don't use it verbatim.  configuring a vimrc from scratch was an incredibly awesome experience and i want you to experience it too.  take a look at my vimrc for ideas, as well as the credits section.\r\n\r\n## installation\r\n\r\n1.  clone this repository into your `~/.vim` directory\r\n1.  `git submodule init && git submodule update`\r\n1.  `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`\r\n1.  install the fonts found in the `font` directory, and head over to the [powerline documentation](https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)\r\n1.  on osx/linux, run `vim` and it will automatically ask you to install plugins.  if you're running a gui vim this check is disabled, so you need to run `:NeoBundleInstall` manually.\r\n1.  done!\r\n\r\n## modifications\r\n\r\n*  if you have either [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) or [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed, they will be used for `grepprg`\r\n*  backup/swap/undo are all turned on and persistant.  they are stored in `~/.vim/.cache` which stays out of your way.\r\n\r\n## mappings\r\n\r\n### insert mode\r\n*  `<C-h>` move the cursor left (default behavior maps to `<BS>`)\r\n*  `<C-l>` move the cursor right (default behavior maps to leave insert mode)\r\n\r\n### normal mode\r\n*  `<leader>fef` format entire file\r\n*  `<leader>f$` strip current line of trailing white space\r\n*  `<leader>fw` find the word under cursor into the quickfix list\r\n*  `<leader>ff` find the last search into the quickfix list\r\n*  `<leader>v` vertical split\r\n*  `<leader>s` horizontal split\r\n*  `<C-h>` `<C-j>` `<C-k>` `<C-l>` move to window in the direction of hkjl\r\n*  `<leader>vsa` vertically split all buffers\r\n*  `/` replaced with `/\\v` for sane regex searching\r\n*  `<Space>` toggles hisearch\r\n*  `<Down>` `<Up>` maps to `:bprev` and `:bnext` respectively\r\n*  `<Left>` `<Right>` maps to `:tabprev` and `:tabnext` respectively\r\n*  `Q` remapped to close windows and delete the buffer (if it is the last buffer window)\r\n*  profiling shortcuts\r\n   * `<leader>DD` starts profiling all functions and files into a file `profile.log`\r\n   * `<leader>DP` pauses profiling\r\n   * `<leader>DC` continues profiling\r\n   * `<leader>DQ` finishs profiling and exits vim\r\n\r\n### visual mode\r\n*  `<leader>s` sort selection\r\n*  `>` and `<` automatically reselects the visual selection\r\n\r\n## macros\r\n*  `@b` place your cursor on _f_unction and it will automatically _.bind it (very useful in javascript).\r\n\r\n## plugins\r\n\r\n###
